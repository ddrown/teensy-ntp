# TODO

Notes from a code review, roughly ordered by priority. Completed items have been moved to
`DONE.md`.

## Design / future work

- [ ] `NTPClients` (NTPClients.cpp) does an O(n) linear scan over all 100 client slots on every
      packet (`addRx`/`addTx`/`findClient`/`expireClients`). Fine at n=100, but note if
      `NUMCLIENTS` ever grows significantly.

## Holdover bench session findings (2026-07-22)

From a real PPS-disconnect holdover test (see `holdover.txt`), roughly in priority order.

- [ ] GPS satellite strong/weak signal counts sometimes jump abruptly (e.g. 5→39) -- observed
      during the 2026-07-22 holdover bench session, not yet investigated.
- [ ] Web UI: "Holdover elapsed" could show elapsed time since the last real PPS pulse instead (or
      in addition), so it lines up directly against "Reference time" for a reader comparing the two.
